### Welcome!

Don't mind me here, I'm mostly just tinkerin'.
My repositories show me dabbling in: 
- Reinforcement Learning Frameworks and Tools
- Programming Language Implementations
- Fun Little Tools from Books and Articles I've Read.
  - [Replacing an Image out of Trebuchets](https://github.com/Brandon-Rozek/treimage)
  - [Replacing the Background of a Webcam Feed](https://github.com/Brandon-Rozek/bodypix-background)
  
Outside of my repos, I contributed to a tool that [generates and verifies cryptographic modes of operations](https://github.com/cryptosolvers/CryptoSolve)
and help maintain a few projects in the [RAIR Lab](https://github.com/RAIRLab) 

During the day, I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
I enjoy sharing what I've learned on a regular basis (over 350 posts!)
and I welcome you to check it out on my website: [brandonrozek.com](https://brandonrozek.com).

Don't hessitate to [get in touch](https://brandonrozek.com/contact/)
if you have any questions or even if you want to chat.
